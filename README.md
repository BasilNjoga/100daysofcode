# 100daysofcode
This is my day by day outline of my progress in the 100 days of code challenge.

### Day one:
Still figuring out how git hub works but im getting better.
working on my c through CS50 hopefully i can complete it soon.
I started my first challenge project, Remaking the netflix website main webpage, i have written most of the html i now need to add the required
css and pictures
#### Thoughts:
Very excited, a bit scared if i can but hopefull

### Day two:
It took a minute to finally get down to coding, but im making strides, im working on the css for my netflix website main page.
I have to take it one step at a time but its getting easier and im really excited to see the final output.
Im not sure how forking works or how to edit the github log so i started my own hopefully ill figure it all out
#### Thoughts: 
It took a bit of struggle to start but i did and im moving.

I started on finishing up on my css classes in freecord.org and working on my typing also
This challenge has similarly encouraged me to pair it up with other things in  my life with the hope of finishing them
#### Thoughts: 
Im a bit tired but inspired and ready to achieve more.
