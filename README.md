# 100daysofcode
This is my day by day outline of my progress in the 100 days of code challenge.

### Day one:
Still figuring out how git hub works but im getting better.
working on my c through CS50 hopefully i can complete it soon.
I started my first challenge project, Remaking the netflix website main webpage, i have written most of the html i now need to add the required
css and pictures
#### Thoughts:
Very excited, a bit scared if i can but hopefull

### Day two:
It took a minute to finally get down to coding, but im making strides, im working on the css for my netflix website main page.
I have to take it one step at a time but its getting easier and im really excited to see the final output.
Im not sure how forking works or how to edit the github log so i started my own hopefully ill figure it all out
#### Thoughts: 
It took a bit of struggle to start but i did and im moving.

### Day Three: 
Ive worked on finalising the css and adding the pictures for my project [Netflix Website updated](#)
I started on finishing up on my css classes in freecord.org and working on my typing also
This challenge has similarly encouraged me to pair it up with other things in  my life with the hope of finishing them
#### Thoughts: 
Im a bit tired but inspired and ready to achieve more.

### Day four: 
Im writing this a bit late because i guess i forgot to update this but i finished most of my css on the site
theres still a few things to be finished but i need to study more to get those down but i will.

### Day five: 
I worked on a c project ive left lying around for weeks now, feels good to finally do it and continue in my cs50 course, 
hopefully i can get this down and finally consider myself a programmer

### Day six: 
I continued with my cs50 course im learning abour arrays, its still confusing but ill figure it out
im finally continuing with my cs50 classes , hopefully i finish this finally its taken like weeks to get here.

### Day seven:
**damn** This isnt as easy as i thoughy it would be, trying to get down my cs50 assignment but its pretty hard and theres a lot i need to
understand before i can complete it, but i dont want to just get taught and breeze through, but also i kinda feel unworthy given just how hard these are and not 
having a clue maybe i dont deserve to be here.
 

### Day eight:
It took a while learning how to make the luhns algorithm for authenticating credit card numbers using c. i dint finish all of it but i had a suitable bearing to begin.
 
 ### Day nine: 
 i finished up on most of the Luhns algorithm assigment, It runs properly i just need to set it to be able to determine the type of card from the number and 
 not just its validity.
#### Thoughts: 
Its getting easier doing this everyday and im making incredible leaps in my coding journey.

### Day ten: 
I focused on learning css today and i learnt a lot about colour gradients and animations, Ive even made my own animaiton for a sky full of stars(pun intended).
#### Thoughts: 
Its takes a minute to get started but once i do i get so immersed in my coding i hardly want to stop, I dint realise theres this much css out there, i just hardly scratched the surface,
I still have my cs50 week three to get down to so i should not forget about that *Keep going basil*
### Day Eleven: 
Ive managed to finally finish up on my luhns algorithm, took a while but finally got it to identify the type of card and its validity from its code

### Day twelve
Wow ive gone missing for a minute but im back, ill just continue from here, today i learnt and polished on my css responsive design and applied
accesibility.
#### Thoughts
i slowed down and i hate that i did, but ill catch up again trust
### Day Thirteen
Here we go , ive finally finished my html and css course on freecodecamp.org it took me a minute but its progress, im currently looking at 
as many projects as i can to get a firm grip of this before i dive into java script.
** i know  im still going to finish cs50 **.

### Day Fourteen.
ive made some progress today, i spent most of the day doing a project on frontend mentor, ive finished on some cs50 class ive been procrastinating on hopefully i
can finish problem set two and keep moving forward
#### Comments
Ive had to give up a lot of my social media its simply wasting so much of my time and the anxiety is just an added burden,im hoping to study more
and to get better at my computer engineering hardware as well. :-)
### Day fifteen 
Ive worked on a project on free code mentor and taken some 
Time to learn more about making shapes and effects with css
### day sixteen(oct 17)
 I continued on my front end mentor challenge, i completed most of it save for responsiveness
 #### comments
 finally realised just how complicated front end is, it took me like two days and the visible progress is so little
 
 ### Day seventeen (oct 18)
 I worked on my projects on freecodecamp i worked on a tribute page and a survey form
 #### comments
 ive trully come a long way, you cant exactly see just how far ive come but i have, ive even tried adapting more of this into my other activities and i hope top eventually
 
 ### Day eighteen (oct 19)
Ive worked on a freecodecamp project for building a business homepage website. used grids for the first time.
### Day ninteen (oct 20) 
i worked on my c., ive made quite some progress since i started hopefully i can make suitable effort and complete this despite destractions
### Day twenty (oct 21)
started working on a technical documentation projects. ive learnt the hard way always to save because i lost all my code and had to do it all over again.it was quite the hustle man.
### Day twenty one( oct 22)
finally finished with my technical documentation project and started immediately on the personal portfolio challenge cant wait to finish
### Day twenty two(oct 23
finished my personal portfolio challenge on freecode camp.org finishing it and finally finishing css and html and looked into some c.
#### Thoughts 
im finally done with this its taken a struggle but im moving albeit slower but sure.
### Day twenty three(oct 24)
slowed down a bit to figure out how exactly im moving. im working on my c challenges. they are a bit hard but ive resolved to continue with cs50 concurrently
as just looking at projects slows me down significantly.
### Day twenty four(oct 25)
